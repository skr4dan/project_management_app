# General
- Use modern Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4 conventions in all code.
- Prefer the cleanest and most maintainable solution.
- When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming.
- Highlight mistakes, anti-patterns, and possible improvements.

# Code Style
- Add typehints everywhere possible using PHP 8.4 features.
- If native types are insufficient, use phpstan annotations.
- Avoid unnecessary comments â€” code should be self-explanatory with clear function and variable names.
- Do not introduce temporary variables unless they simplify a complex expression.

# Architecture
- Apply SOLID and OOP principles in all design decisions.
- Use a service layer and repository pattern, with filters as separate criteria objects.
- Keep services highly specific; avoid god classes (e.g., `OrderService` tied directly to a model).
